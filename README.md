## Intro!
Please provide a brief self-introduction below (year, hometown, favorite food, anything you would like to share with us!) to help us get to know you a little better :) 

Hi, my name is Guansu(Frances) Niu, and I was born in 1995. My hometown is Nanjing, China. My favorite food is Chinese hotpot. I have a cat called Sashimi, which is also one of my favorite food :)
